## Introduction

This repository is a personal project aimed at tracking my progress in web development. It allows me to document my daily learning journey and experiment with different frameworks, technologies, and concepts.

## Folder Structure

- **Daily_Logs**: Contains daily log files where I document my progress.
- **Frameworks**: This folder is for exploring and experimenting with various frameworks.
- **Projects**: Space for personal projects and experiments.

## Daily Progress

In the `Daily_Logs` folder, you will find daily log files named with the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD.md`. In these files, I record:

- What I learned
- Challenges encountered
- Ideas for improvement
- Resources I found useful

## Frameworks

The `Frameworks` folder is dedicated to experimenting with different web development frameworks. Each framework will have its own subfolder, containing code samples, projects, and documentation related to that particular framework.

Feel free to suggest new frameworks for experimentation or contribute by adding your own insights and experiences with existing frameworks.
